# Heart-Disease-Predictor
## Dataset Information

The data used here is the heart disease dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset is a valuable tool in the ML community for predicting the presence of heart disease in individuals.
For more details and to access the dataset, visit [Heart Disease UCI on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

## Objective

The primary aim is not just to predict the onset of heart disease, but to evaluate and compare the performance (using the F1 score as the metric) of different machine learning algorithms.
 This provides insights into which algorithms are potentially more suitable for real-world applications in this domain.

## Algorithms Evaluated

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
